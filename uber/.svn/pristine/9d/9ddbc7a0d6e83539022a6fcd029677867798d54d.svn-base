The Neptune theme for Ext Gantt.

How to use the package in a workspace:

1) Install the package (extract `*.pkg` file into packages folder in your workspace or use `sencha package add *.pkg` if you have repository configured).

2) Configure your app.json. The package is supposed to be used along with the `bryntum-gantt-pro` package. So you need to add both of them to the `requires` section:

	{
		"name" : "MyApp",

		// the gantt and its theme
		"requires" : [
			"bryntum-gantt-pro",
			"bryntum-gantt-pro-neptune"
		],

		...
	}

**Please note** that the package cannot be used in the `theme` config of `app.json`.
