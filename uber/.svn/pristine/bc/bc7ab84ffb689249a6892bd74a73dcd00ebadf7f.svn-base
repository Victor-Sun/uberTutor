The Neptune theme for Ext Scheduler.

How to use the package in a workspace:
  
1) Install the package (extract `*.pkg` file into packages folder in your workspace or use `sencha package add *.pkg` if you have repository configured).

2) Configure your app.json. The package is supposed to be used along with the `bryntum-scheduler` package. So you need to add both of them to the `requires` section:

	{
		"name" : "MyApp",
		
		// the scheduler and its theme
		"requires" : [
			"bryntum-scheduler",
			"bryntum-scheduler-neptune"
		],
		
		...
	}

**Please note** that the package cannot be used in the `theme` config of `app.json`.
