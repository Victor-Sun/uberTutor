    // write/filter/sort at all, as for add/remove/removeAll it listens to preceding events like 'add'/'remove'/'clear'
    // and reflects updates correspondingly. But in case of loadRecords() the sequence of events fired 'datachanged' and
    // 'refresh' provides too little information to make right decision whether to reset a cache or not, moreover resetting
    // a cache on 'refresh' is to late since a lot of logic (rendering logic especially) start quering the store
    // upon 'datachanged' event and thus if cache wasn't reset it will provide that logic with outdated data.

    // a way to reset itself beforehand.
